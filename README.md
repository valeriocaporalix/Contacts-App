This project was created solely for training, during a targeted study path, after having performed basic programming courses.
The purpose of the development of this application was to implement all the subjects of the course of study, thus reviewing the fundamental principles of MERN development.
I conclude with a heartfelt thanks to all those who are helping me to achieve and complete my studies. Thank you!
